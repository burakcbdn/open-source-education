# Open Source Education

The proposed initiative aims to address Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 4 (Quality Education) and 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). The selected indicator for SDG 4 is 4.4.1 - Proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology (ICT) skills, focusing on enhancing digital literacy and preparing participants for the modern workforce. For SDG 8, the chosen indicator is 8.6.1 - Proportion of youth not in education, employment, or training, with the goal of providing job skills training to reduce youth unemployment.

The importance of these SDGs for global sustainability lies in fostering a skilled and adaptable workforce, driving innovation, and ensuring inclusive economic growth. In the context of our country, addressing these goals is crucial for developing a competitive workforce, reducing unemployment rates, and contributing to overall economic development.
